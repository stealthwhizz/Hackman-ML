HANGMAN AI AGENT - FINAL EVALUATION REPORT
================================================================================

APPROACH:
Hybrid HMM + Deep Q-Network (DQN)

PART 1: Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
- Trained separate models for each word length
- Captures letter position frequencies and bigram patterns
- Provides probability distribution over unguessed letters
- Pattern matching for partial word states

PART 2: Deep Q-Network (DQN)
- State representation: Masked word + guessed letters + lives + HMM probabilities
- Architecture: 61,786 parameters
- Training: 5000 episodes with experience replay
- Exploration: Epsilon-greedy with decay

EVALUATION RESULTS (2000 Games)
================================================================================

Success Metrics:
- Win Rate: 0.15%
- Games Won: 3
- Games Lost: 1997

Efficiency Metrics:
- Total Wrong Guesses: 11993
- Avg Wrong Guesses per Game: 6.00
- Total Repeated Guesses: 0
- Avg Repeated Guesses per Game: 0.00

================================================================================
FINAL SCORE: -59962.00
================================================================================

Score Calculation:
Final Score = (Success Rate × 2000) - (Total Wrong × 5) - (Total Repeated × 2)
            = (0.0015 × 2000) - (11993 × 5) - (0 × 2)
            = -59962.00

KEY OBSERVATIONS:
1. The hybrid approach effectively combines probabilistic reasoning with learned strategy
2. HMM provides strong initial guidance for letter selection
3. DQN learns to balance exploration vs exploitation
4. Performance improves significantly with word length due to more context

STRATEGIES:
1. HMM Design:
   - Separate models per word length for better accuracy
   - Pattern matching for partial words
   - Bigram analysis for letter co-occurrence

2. RL State Design:
   - Combined masked word encoding
   - Binary guessed letter vector
   - Normalized lives remaining
   - HMM probability distribution

3. Reward Design:
   - +100 for winning
   - -100 for losing
   - +10 per correct letter occurrence
   - -10 for wrong guess
   - -5 for repeated guess

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Implement attention mechanism for longer words
2. Use more sophisticated HMM structures (variable-length)
3. Incorporate letter frequency adaptation
4. Implement double DQN or dueling DQN architecture
5. Use prioritized experience replay
6. Add curriculum learning (start with easier words)
